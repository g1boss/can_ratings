This notebook provides tools for cleaning up the rental registrations so there is a usable 'acctid' field.  \n","\n","The methodology here is to accumulate corrections in a file that can be applied to correct the data.  That way we can accumulate fixes in this notebook, and have a file we can use to record fixes that we have to resolve manually (looking in SDAT, checking a map, etc).\n","\n","There is also code at
