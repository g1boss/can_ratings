This can be due to entry errors in the complaint data, or changes in ownership over the complaint period. The default behavior, used as the fixed behavior here, is to return the least ambiguous dominant cluster id.  What this means practically is if the most often cited cluster == -1 (no cluster), but the second most frequent citation in the period is a valid cluster, that valid cluster is assinged to the tax id.  If more than one valid cluster is cited, the most frequently cited is used.\n","\n","Some of the violations have no tax acctid, in some cases because of address spelling issues.  Some of these can be backfilled.  The ones we can fix, we do.  Many of the others are just vacant lots which will drop out on the join with properties licenesed for rental."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1e-7df1iQCXC"},"source":["def best_cluster(cnumbers):\n","  if len(cnumbers) > 1 and cnumbers.index[0] < 0:\n","    return cnumbers.index[1]\n","  else:\n","    return cnumbers.index[0]\n","    \n","vc_df = pd.DataFrame(violations.groupby(['APN'])['contactadd_cluster'].agg(lambda x:best_cluster(x.value_counts())))#.to_dict()\n","cadd_c = violations.groupby(['APN'])['contact_cluster'].agg(lambda x:best_cluster(x.value_counts()))\n","vc_df = vc_df.merge(cadd_c,left_index=True,right_index=True)\n","\n","# fix tax account id's where possible\n","vc_df = vc_df.merge(vs2, on='APN',how='inner')\n","vc_df"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ji8ljMV4aw-V"},"source":["### Save result as violation_clusters.csv\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Ao-IAr-8cWpR"},"source":["vc_df.to_csv('drive/My Drive/pita 2020/violation_clusters.csv')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"G0itnP-i8gWr"},"source":["vsample = violations.query('(Open_Date > \"2018-12-31\")')[['APN','address','contact_cluster','Contact_Name','contactadd_cluster','Contact_Address']]\n","vsample.APN = vsample.APN.astype(str)\n","vsample = vsample.rename(columns={'APN':'acctid'})\n","vsample.acctid = vsample.apply(lambda x: x.acctid.strip(u'\\u200b'),axis=1)\n","vsample.address = vsample.apply(lambda x: re.sub(r' +',' ',x.address).strip(),axis=1)\n","\n","noacctid = vsample.query('acctid == \"\"',engine='python').address.array\n","found_acctids = {v[0]:v[1] for v in df.query('address in @noacctid')[['address','acctid']].values}\n","vsample.acctid = vsample.apply(lambda x: found_acctids.get(x.address,x.acctid),axis=1)\n","vsample.query('acctid == \"\"',engine='python').address.array\n","#.query('Contact_Name.str.contains(\"GLG\")',engine='python')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"d25KY54XEhe4"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
